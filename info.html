<div class="container">
    <h2>"Noli Me Tangere"</h2>
    <p>Noli Me Tangere" is a novel written by the Filipino national hero, 
        Dr. José Rizal. Published in 1887, it is considered one of the most 
        influential works of Philippine literature. The title, which translates 
        to "Touch Me Not" in English, is derived from a Latin phrase that appears 
        in the Bible, specifically when Jesus Christ tells Mary Magdalene not to 
        touch him after his resurrection.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Berlin"</h2>
    <p>"Noli Me Tangere" was published in Berlin, Germany. José Rizal, the
        author of the novel, completed the manuscript while he was studying 
        and living in Europe. Due to the strict censorship laws in the Philippines
        under Spanish colonial rule, Rizal opted to have the novel published abroad 
        to avoid potential suppression or backlash from the colonial authorities. 
        In 1887, the novel was printed and published by the printing press of Berliner
        Buchdruckerei-Actiengesellschaft in Berlin. Its publication in Berlin allowed
         the novel to reach a wider audience and played a significant role in shaping 
         Filipino national consciousness and sparking resistance against Spanish oppression.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Laong Laan"</h2>
    <p>The pen name used by José Rizal in his writings for La Solidaridad, 
        a reformist newspaper published in Spain, was "Laong Laan." 
        Rizal contributed numerous articles and essays to the newspaper, 
        addressing various social, political, and economic issues in the Philippines 
        during the late 19th century. "Laong Laan" translates to "Ever Prepared" or "Always Ready" 
        in English, reflecting Rizal's steadfast commitment to advocating for reforms and 
        promoting national consciousness among the Filipino people.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Sa Aking mga Kabata"</h2>
    <p>The first poem written by José Rizal, often considered his earliest work, 
        is titled "Sa Aking Mga Kabata" ("To My Fellow Youth" or "To My Childhood Companions"). 
        Rizal wrote this poem in his native language, Tagalog, when he was just eight years old. 
            <br>
        The poem encourages young Filipinos to embrace their mother tongue, 
        preserve their cultural heritage, and strive for knowledge. It emphasizes 
        the importance of education in shaping the future of the nation. "Sa Aking Mga Kabata" 
        serves as a precursor to Rizal's later works, which would delve deeper into the issues 
        of national identity, social reform, and the fight against colonial oppression.</p>

        studying in Europe. He is the heir of a wealthy and influential
         family in the town of San Diego, but his experiences abroad have

         businessman and supporter of José Rizal. He provided financial 
         assistance to Rizal to help cover the expenses of printing and 
         publishing the novel. His generosity and support were crucial in 
         making the publication of "Noli Me Tangere" possible, as Rizal faced 
         financial constraints and difficulty finding sponsors due to the
          controversial nature of the novel's content. Valentin Ventura's
           contribution played a significant role in ensuring the dissemination 
           of the novel and its impact on Filipino society.</p>

    <h2>"Ang huling Paalam"</h2>

          by Rizal is "Mi Último Adiós" or "My Last Farewell." It is considered
           his farewell poem, written on the eve of his execution, and reflects
            his profound love for his country and his dedication to its freedom.

        In "Mi Último Adiós," Rizal bids farewell to his beloved Philippines,
         expressing his sentiments of sacrifice, martyrdom, and hope for a better 
         future. The poem encapsulates his unwavering patriotism and serves as a 
         testament to his commitment to the Filipino people. It resonates with profound 
         emotion and displays Rizal's mastery of language and poetic expression.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Fr. Rufino Collantes"</h2>
    <p>The priest who baptized José Rizal was Father Rufino Collantes.
         Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines.
          His parents, Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso, arranged for 
          his baptism at the local church shortly after his birth. 
          Father Rufino Collantes, a Catholic priest, performed the baptism
           ceremony and officially named the newborn child José Protasio Rizal
            Mercado y Alonso Realonda. This event marked the beginning of Rizal's 
            journey in life, leading him to become one of the most significant
             figures in Philippine history..</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Leonor Rivera"</h2>
    <p>The person who is often considered as the inspiration for the
         character of Maria Clara in José Rizal's "Noli Me Tangere" 
         is Leonor Rivera. Leonor Rivera was Rizal's childhood sweetheart
          and love interest. She was known for her beauty, intelligence, 
          and talents. Rizal and Rivera had a deep and affectionate relationship,
           which endured despite the challenges and obstacles they faced, 
           including Rizal's travels and eventual exile.

        In "Noli Me Tangere," the character of Maria Clara represents the
         idealized Filipina of that era – gentle, virtuous, and embodying
          the values of purity and self-sacrifice. Rizal used Maria Clara 
          as a symbol of the plight of Filipino women and the societal 
          constraints they faced under Spanish colonial rule.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Paciano"</h2>

        older brother, Paciano Rizal.

        Paciano Rizal, being José Rizal's eldest brother, 
        played a significant role in shaping Rizal's nationalist and reformist views. 
        He served as a source of inspiration and mentor to Rizal,
         influencing his perspective on social issues and the need for 
         change in Philippine society.</p>

    <h2>"November 15, 1895"</h2>
    <p>The last issue of La Solidaridad, the newspaper of the Propaganda 
        Movement, was published on November 15, 1895. La Solidaridad was
         a significant publication during the late 19th century and served
          as a platform for Filipino reformists to voice their concerns
           about social, political, and economic issues in the Philippines. 
           It played a crucial role in advocating for reforms and raising 
           awareness among Filipinos and the international community about
            the injustices of Spanish colonial rule. The publication ceased 
            due to financial difficulties and government suppression, but its
             impact on the national consciousness and the pursuit of Philippine
              independence remained significant.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Binan"</h2>
    <p>Jose Rizal began his formal schooling at the age of three.
         In 1865, he enrolled in a private school called "Casa Escuela" 
         in his hometown of Calamba, Laguna, Philippines. Casa Escuela 
         was run by his mother, Teodora Alonso, who was a highly educated woman.
          Under her guidance, Rizal received his early education, learning the 
          basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. This early foundation
           would later pave the way for his pursuit of higher education and
            his remarkable intellectual achievements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"Concepcion"</h2>
    <p>
        The first sorrow of Jose Rizal, as mentioned in his autobiography
         "A Memoir of My Childhood," was the death of his younger sister,
          Conception. Conception Mercado Rizal was born in 1862 and was 
          the second child of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. 
          However, she died at a very young age, just a few hours after 
          birth. Rizal described her death as his "first conscious sorrow,"
           marking an early experience of loss and grief that would shape
            his sensitivity and empathy towards others throughout his life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>"His Mother"</h2>
    <p>Jose Rizal's first teacher was his mother, Teodora Alonso. 
        Teodora Alonso was a highly educated woman who recognized 
        the importance of education and took it upon herself to 
        teach her children at home. She taught Rizal and his siblings 
        basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills during their early years. 
        Teodora Alonso's influence as Rizal's first teacher played a significant 
        role in nurturing his love for learning and laying the foundation for 
        his future education and intellectual pursuits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2> "Five"</h2>
    <p>Jose Rizal was able to read and write at a very young age.

          from a very early age he learned the alphabet from his mother at 3.
           It is said that he could already read and write by the age of five. 
           This early proficiency in literacy
           was nurtured by his mother, Teodora Alonso, who played a crucial
            role in his early education. Teodora recognized Rizal's intellectual
             potential and provided him with the necessary guidance and support
              to develop his reading and writing skills. Rizal's early mastery
               of literacy laid the foundation for his later achievements as
                a writer, poet, and national hero of the Philippines.</p>
